    <meta name="description" content="Cyber-attacks are getting increasingly complex, and as a result, the functional concerns of intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) are becoming increasingly difficult to resolve. The credibility of security services, such as privacy preservation, authenticity, and accessibility, may be jeopardized if breaches are not detected. Different organizations currently utilize a variety of tactics, strategies, and technology to protect the systems&rsquo; credibility in order to combat these dangers. Safeguarding approaches include establishing rules and procedures, developing user awareness, deploying firewall and verification systems, regulating system access, and forming computer-issue management groups. The effectiveness of intrusion-detection systems is not sufficiently recognized. IDS is used in businesses to examine possibly harmful tendencies occurring in technological environments. Determining an effective IDS is a complex task for organizations that require consideration of many key criteria and their sub-aspects. To deal with these multiple and interrelated criteria and their sub-aspects, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCMD) approach was applied. These criteria and their sub-aspects can also include some ambiguity and uncertainty, and thus they were treated using q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFS) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Additionally, the problem of combining expert and specialist opinions was dealt with using the q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric (q-ROFWG). Initially, the entropy method was applied to assess the priorities of the key criteria and their sub-aspects. Then, the combined compromised solution (CoCoSo) method was applied to evaluate six IDSs according to their effectiveness and reliability. Afterward, comparative and sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the stability, reliability, and performance of the proposed approach. The findings indicate that most of the IDSs appear to be systems with high potential. According to the results, Suricata is the best IDS that relies on multi-threading performance." >

          <div class="html-p">Cyber-attacks are getting increasingly complex, and as a result, the functional concerns of intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) are becoming increasingly difficult to resolve. The credibility of security services, such as privacy preservation, authenticity, and accessibility, may be jeopardized if breaches are not detected. Different organizations currently utilize a variety of tactics, strategies, and technology to protect the systems&rsquo; credibility in order to combat these dangers. Safeguarding approaches include establishing rules and procedures, developing user awareness, deploying firewall and verification systems, regulating system access, and forming computer-issue management groups. The effectiveness of intrusion-detection systems is not sufficiently recognized. IDS is used in businesses to examine possibly harmful tendencies occurring in technological environments. Determining an effective IDS is a complex task for organizations that require consideration of many key criteria and their sub-aspects. To deal with these multiple and interrelated criteria and their sub-aspects, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCMD) approach was applied. These criteria and their sub-aspects can also include some ambiguity and uncertainty, and thus they were treated using q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFS) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Additionally, the problem of combining expert and specialist opinions was dealt with using the q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric (q-ROFWG). Initially, the entropy method was applied to assess the priorities of the key criteria and their sub-aspects. Then, the combined compromised solution (CoCoSo) method was applied to evaluate six IDSs according to their effectiveness and reliability. Afterward, comparative and sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the stability, reliability, and performance of the proposed approach. The findings indicate that most of the IDSs appear to be systems with high potential. According to the results, Suricata is the best IDS that relies on multi-threading performance.</div>

    <section  id='sec1-sensors-22-04123' type='intro'><h2 data-nested='1'>  1. Introduction</h2><div class='html-p'>The continuous development of computer systems has led to the increasing dependence of companies, organizations, and people on computer networks in performing their functions and offering their services in modern ways [<a href="#B1-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">1</a>]. However, at the same time, it has become vulnerable to penetration by attackers with the aim of making illegal gains by exploiting some security vulnerabilities, which led to an increase in interest in issues of protection and security of these systems. Today there are many methods used within this field, and there are many intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) available [<a href="#B2-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">2</a>]. IDSs are a necessity for the stability of an organization’s normal system performance. In this regard, traditional intrusion-detection techniques are highly unrewarding and ineffective due to the multiplicity of attack methods and their different forms. Among the traditional methods used previously are obfuscation, transformation, and polymorphism techniques, which lead to malware resistance [<a href="#B3-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">3</a>]. Despite the prominent role it plays, it still has some shortcomings. Therefore, there was a need to continue conducting research on intrusion-detection systems in order to reach an optimal structure that achieves a high protection rate.</div><div class='html-p'>The internet changed the concept of computing as we know it. The possibilities and opportunities available became unlimited, and with it, the risks and opportunities for breakthroughs increased. Computer security primarily focuses on protecting a specific source or valuable data and information within a single computer device. Security is defined as the reaction taken to security threats resulting from a harmful act by some people. The value of the data can be violated in three ways: privacy, integrity, and availability of information [<a href="#B4-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">4</a>]. Computer protection is generally referred to by the term CIA, which is represented by the following three concepts: </div><div class='html-p'><ul class='html-bullet'><li><div class='html-p'>Confidentiality: Preventing unauthorized persons from disclosing or accessing information; i.e., accessing information only by authorized persons.</div></li><li><div class='html-p'>Integrity: Maintaining information integrity by preventing unauthorized modification.</div></li><li><div class='html-p'>Availability: It is the ability of a computer to work and provide the resources and services expected of it to legitimate people upon request.</div></li></ul></div><div class='html-p'>Network security includes all actions or activities taken by organizations and companies in order to protect resources and ensure the integrity and continuity of operations across networks [<a href="#B5-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">5</a>]. Security policies also define the permissions available to users in the way they use network components and resources. In order to build an effective network-protection strategy, all potential security threats must be identified, and then the most effective set of tools to combat them must be selected [<a href="#B6-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">6</a>]. Preventing all exploits for vulnerabilities in networks and systems is not possible [<a href="#B7-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">7</a>]. Network protection is achieved through the use of a set of components at several levels, with the aim of protecting organizations from internal attacks and external attacks as much as possible. A firewall is a component that achieves the most basic level of protection but is not sufficient on its own. Designing and implementing a completely secure system is very difficult in practice, but it is possible to detect intrusions and take appropriate measures to protect against them. This is what the IDS basically does, as it is used as an alert system, within the security and protection system, that gives an alert when it detects an attempt by someone to penetrate the computer system or network [<a href="#B8-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">8</a>]. As a result, IDSs are important in a network security solution. The primary goal of IDSs is to detect an intrusion while it is occurring rather than after it has ended, and then alert the person responsible for the problem by sending an email or setting off an alert. It must be able to take any action to minimize harm to the system due to the hack. The second goal is to collect data from the system, record all important events, and determine the source of the attack, and these data are used for legal purposes as evidence or proof against the attacker.</div><div class='html-p'>IDSs must be placed in strategic places so that they are able to see network traffic in order to analyze it and thus achieve the maximum benefit from it [<a href="#B9-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">9</a>]. In this regard, several ways to classify IDSs are described using different analysis and control methods. The most common way to classify intrusion-detection systems is to group them according to the location of the information source. Basic information sources are network packets captured from a network backbone or local network segments, operating systems, and critical files. Intrusion-detection systems can be classified into host-based detection-intrusion systems, network-based intrusion-detection systems, and hybrid systems. On the user’s computer, a host-based intrusion-detection system (HIDS) is installed. HIDSs operate on information collected from within a single computer system [<a href="#B10-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">10</a>]. HIDSs employ monitoring sensors, also called clients, on each host to be monitored. In general, the most common forms of information sources for HIDSs are operating system audit logs, system logs, and critical system files [<a href="#B10-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">10</a>]. The customer checks these sources for unauthorized changes or patterns of suspicious activity. This allows HIDSs to reliably analyze activities, accurately identifying which users and which processes are participating in a specific attack on the operating system. The most common form of IDSs is network-based intrusion-detection systems (NIDSs) [<a href="#B11-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">11</a>]; also, most companies and organizations are often supported by NIDSs along with firewalls. These systems detect attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets by listening to network segments or switches [<a href="#B11-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">11</a>]. In this case, the system is placed on an entire network segment and not on a single device within the network, or it is placed to monitor a gateway on the switch. Thus, it can monitor all mobile packets between groups of computers connected to the network, by matching one or more packets with the database of signatures of attacks, or by analyzing the traffic to detect anomalies. NIDSs can be taken advantage of by placing it outside of firewalls, thus alerting the responsible person to incoming packets that might circumvent the firewall. Both HIDSs and NIDSs have strengths and benefits that complement each other [<a href="#B12-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">12</a>]. <a href="#sensors-22-04123-f001" class="html-fig">Figure 1</a> introduces the general architecture of an HIDS and NIDS. The next generation of IDSs must combine the two technologies in order to improve the network’s resistance to attacks and abuse. In addition, they should enhance security policy and provide greater flexibility in application and deployment options. A hybrid IDS is a mixture of an HIDS and NIDS. It provides a combination of the strengths of the two methods. Their modus operandi varies from product to product, making it difficult to define and determine hybrid intrusion systems in a more accurate manner.</div><div class='html-p'>Afterward, detection methods are the basis of intrusion-detection techniques, which are the engine in detecting the malicious activities of the information source. Detection methods analyze the information they monitor and trigger alerts if malicious traffic is detected. Accordingly, IDSs can be categorized, according to the detection methods used, into anomaly-based intrusion-detection systems (AIDSs) [<a href="#B13-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">13</a>] and signature-based intrusion-detection systems (SIDSs) [<a href="#B14-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">14</a>]. In this regard, AIDSs operate on the assumption that malicious events are different from normal actions, and thus the differences are sought to detect the attack. These systems constitute profiles of historical data collected during a period of normal operation. It then collects event data to determine when the monitored activity deviates from normal behavior and triggers an alarm. SIDSs also are called signature-based detection because alerts are generated based on the signatures of specific attacks. This type of signature attack involves specific traffic or activity based on known hacking activity. It is also called misuse-based detection. The basic premise is the model that has been written to describe bad behavior, after which the system compares the sequence of information with this model to decide what is normal and what is malicious. These systems are accurate and emit fewer false alarms, but they do not detect a hack unless there is a predetermined model for it.</div><div class='html-p'>Nowadays, Internet networks are vulnerable to a wide range of threats and attacks, such as impersonation, privilege breaches, data loss, altered and fraudulent data units, and denial of connections [<a href="#B15-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">15</a>]. Therefore, IDSs have an essential task to protect the normal system performance of an organization. It is, therefore, necessary to add new security requirements and additional networking measures to the network security requirements [<a href="#B16-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">16</a>]. IDSs must constantly change and adapt to all these new threats and assault technologies. Therefore, the process of determining the best IDS for network protection, threat warning, and cyber-attacks is a very difficult task in light of the various criteria on which an IDS is developed. Thus, IDSs should not be chosen to quickly secure the network without a thorough understanding of the technology, solutions, and potential consequences.</div><div class='html-p'>In this study, a set of criteria were adopted to evaluate IDSs according to previous studies and expert opinions. The criteria that have been adopted were divided into four basic criteria—protected system, audit source location, alerts, and types—and each main criterion includes several sub-aspects. The set of sub-aspects are as follows: HIDS, NIDS, hybrids, host log files, network packets, application log files, IDS sensor application, network, host, open-source, closed source, and freeware. In order to solve such complex problems related to the evaluation of IDSs, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) has been proven to be one of the best tools for the effective evaluation of IDS [<a href="#B16-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">16</a>]. MCDM is popular in complex problems because it enables the decision-maker to take care of all the available criteria and take an appropriate decision as per the priority [<a href="#B17-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">17</a>]. Since the ideal choice is governed by multiple criteria, a good decision-maker, in certain situations, may look for criteria of high impact on which to focus.</div><div class='html-p'>Consequently, due to the assessment of IDSs under multiple criteria and a pluralistic viewpoint, the assessment process is tainted by ambiguity and uncertainty, which is difficult to deal with in real numbers. Hence, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) theory has been applied to deal with such complex problems [<a href="#B18-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">18</a>]. The q-ROFS proved to be effective in solving ambiguous and uncertain problems as it came as a generalization of the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) [<a href="#B19-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">19</a>] and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) theories [<a href="#B20-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">20</a>].</div><div class='html-p'>Finally, to deal with the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of IDSs, a hybrid approach consisting of two multi-criteria decision-making methods, the entropy method [<a href="#B21-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">21</a>] and the combined compromised solution (CoCoSo) method [<a href="#B22-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">22</a>], was adopted. The proposed hybrid approach is presented under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment and by utilizing the q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs) numbers. Firstly, the entropy method was adopted to evaluate the main and sub-aspects and to determine the final weights. Secondly, the CoCoSo method was applied to evaluate the available alternatives and determine the best alternative.</div><div class='html-p'>The main contributions of this study can be listed as follows: (i) a novel hybrid MCDM approach is proposed for the evaluation of the IDS; (ii) this hybrid MCDM approach is named q-ROF entropy-CoCoSo, which give assessments of subjective and impartial expert insights; (iii) the q-ROFSs method is conducted to handle the uncertainty in experts’ evaluations; (iv) a q-ROF entropy is utilized to compute the criteria weights; and (v) a q-ROF CoCoSo is suggested to evaluate the selected IDSs.</div><div class='html-p'>The article is organized as follows: <a href="#sec2-sensors-22-04123" class="html-sec">Section 2</a> highlights the IDS and insights into MCDM; <a href="#sec3-sensors-22-04123" class="html-sec">Section 3</a> introduces some preliminaries of q-ROFS and the proposed research approach; <a href="#sec4-sensors-22-04123" class="html-sec">Section 4</a> illustrates the application of the MCDM approach in evaluating the IDS and discussion; and <a href="#sec5-sensors-22-04123" class="html-sec">Section 5</a> contains the conclusions.</div><div class="html-fig-wrap" id="sensors-22-04123-f001">

Background Information</h2><div class='html-p'>This section provides basic knowledge about IDSs to enable a deeper understanding of this topic; also, some basic information related to MCDM is presented. Afterward, some studies related to q-ROF theory are introduced. Alyami et al. presented a study based on a hybrid MCDM approach consisting of the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate the effectiveness of the IDSs [<a href="#B16-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">16</a>]. In their study, they used four main criteria and thirteen sub-aspects to evaluate five IDSs. Their results indicate that Suricata is the most effective IDS. Their results also indicate that most of the IDSs that were evaluated in the study are effective and close in their results. Abushark et al. developed a study to evaluate the optimization of machine learning-based IDSs using a hybrid MCDM approach that comprises the AHP and TOPSIS in a fuzzy environment [<a href="#B24-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">24</a>]. Their findings aim to identify attributes related to cyber security, allowing the design of more effective and efficient IDSs. Al-Harbi et al. presented a study for an optimal evaluation of machine learning-based IDSs using a hybrid MCDM model that includes AHP and TOPSIS under hesitant fuzzy conditions [<a href="#B8-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">8</a>]. Their findings aim to identify features related to cyber security, allowing the design of more effective and IDSs. Almotiri presented an evaluation system to detect malicious traffic based on system performance [<a href="#B25-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">25</a>]. They adopted an MCDM approach consisting of AHP–TOPSIS methods to rank the impact of alternatives according to their overall performance. Their study aims to be a reference for practitioners working in the field of evaluating and selecting the most effective traffic detection approach.</div><div class='html-p'>Afterward, some studies related to MCDM approaches and their applications in different fields were presented. Sharma and Kaul presented a study to deal with network performance delays and disruptions due to cluster-based communications that place a significant burden on the cluster head (CH) [<a href="#B26-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">26</a>]. They used an MCDM approach including two AHP–TOPSIS methods to reduce the overburden on a single CH through a multi-CH scheme. Ogundoyin and Kamil presented a study to address security and privacy issues where fog servers can be used to process private and respond to time-sensitive information [<a href="#B27-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">27</a>]. They applied the fuzzy AHP MCDM approach to determine and prioritize confidence parameters in fog computing. Their results indicate that quality of service is the best priority parameter that a service requester can use to evaluate the trusted standard of a service provider. Kumar et al. introduced a study to evaluate the impact of various malware analysis methods on the perspective of web applications [<a href="#B28-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">28</a>]. They applied an MCDM approach that comprises AHP and TOPSIS methods under a fuzzy environment. Their results indicate that reverse engineering is the most effective method for analyzing complex malware.</div><div class='html-p'>There are many theories dealing with uncertainty, including the q-ROFS theory. Thus, we present some related studies as follows. Duane et al. introduced a study to deal with risks in information sharing and software piracy, which poses a threat to any system [<a href="#B29-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">29</a>]. They applied the q-rung orthopair double hierarchy linguistic term set (q-RODHLTS) in the MCDM process. To prove the validity of their results, they applied the proposed approach to many information security systems. Panetikul et al. presented a study to analyze computer security threat analysis and control under a q-ROF environment [<a href="#B30-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">30</a>]. They applied an approach based on the combination of the Heronian mean (HM) operator with complex q-ROFS is to initiate the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy HM (Cq-ROFHM) operator. To prove the reliability and efficiency of the techniques used, some illustrative examples are introduced. Cheng et al. presented a study for evaluating sustainable enterprise risk management in manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises [<a href="#B31-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">31</a>]. They adopted a new extended Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) approach using q-ROFSs. Peng et al. introduced a study for presenting a new score function of q-ROFN for solving the failure issues when comparing two q-ROFNs [<a href="#B32-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">32</a>].</div><div class='html-p'>Finally, given the importance of IDSs and the importance of implementing them in a manner appropriate to their specific situation, choosing the most effective and appropriate one is a great challenge. Hence, there is an urgent and great need to evaluate IDSs. In this regard, a set of main and sub-criteria affecting the selection of the most effective IDS is identified; also, a set of alternatives are identified to be evaluated according to these criteria, using an MCDM approach and under a q-ROF environment.</div></section><section  id='sec3-sensors-22-04123' type=''><h2 data-nested='1'>  3.

Suggested Approach</h4><div class='html-p'>In this part, a sequential multi-step approach is presented to evaluate several intrusion-detection systems by combining two MCDM methods, namely, Entropy-CoCoSo. The proposed approach was performed under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment and by using q-ROFNs. The proposed approach was divided into three main parts. The data aggregation part includes identifying experts, selecting the criteria used, and determining the IDSs alternatives available. Then, the criteria evaluation part assesses the selected criteria using the q-ROF Entropy method. After that, the alternatives evaluation part assesses the available IDSs using the q-ROF CoCoSo method. The steps of the proposed approach are shown in <a href="#sensors-22-04123-f003" class="html-fig">Figure 3</a>. Consequently, the steps of the suggested approach used are presented in detail as follows:</div><div class='html-p'><b><span class='html-italic'>Step 1</span></b><b>.</b> The problem was studied and its main and sub-aspects were identified. The basic criteria for selecting the participating experts also were established. The criteria for selecting experts were determined as follows: the participants should have sufficient experience in the field of cyber security and the field of information security in general; also, their experience in the field of information security should not be less than 10 years. In addition, the participants should have practical experience in the field of information security technology and in the academic field. Next, the number of experts (<math display='inline'><semantics>

After that, the participating experts were divided into several groups and the appropriate weight for each group was determined according to the measure of experience. Finally, the most appropriate means of communication with the participating experts were determined.</div><div class='html-p'><b><span class='html-italic'>Step 2</span></b>.

Suricata is the main alternative to Snort because the design of Suricata is very close to that of Snort [<a href="#B37-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">37</a>]. Suricata has an advantage over Snort, which is that it collects data at the application layer. Suricata consists of so-called threads, thread units, and queues. Suricata is a multi-threaded program, so there will be multiple threads running at the same time [<a href="#B37-sensors-22-04123" class="html-bibr">37</a>]. Thread units are divided according to functions; for example, one unit is used to analyze data packets, and the other unit is used to discover data packets. Each data packet can be processed by several different threads, and the queue is used to transfer the data packet from one thread to another. At the same time, a thread can contain several thread units, but only one unit runs at a given time.</div></li><li><div class='html-p'><b>Zeek (</b><math display='inline'><semantics>

Zeek uses network-based intrusion-detection methods by tracking the network and searching for malicious activities.

Initially, a set of standards was identified to select the experts involved with the researchers in the study to evaluate the IDSs. The standards were as follows: the number of years of experience should not be less than 10 years in the field of cyber security and the field of information security in general; also, the scientific degree of the participating experts must not be lower than M.Sc. Accordingly, 60 experts were selected to participate in the IDSs evaluation process. After that, the participating experts were divided into four groups. Each group included a certain number of experts. The first and fourth groups included 12 experts. Whereas, the second and third groups included 18 experts. Accordingly, the appropriate weight was assigned to each group according to the years of experience and the number of experts. So, the first, second, third, and fourth groups had weights of 0.20, 0.30, 0.30, and 0.20, respectively. In addition, a leader was assigned to each group to express the final opinion in the evaluation process.

Sensitivity Analysis</h4><div class='html-p'>We have conducted a sensitivity analysis from the three perspectives of changes in parameter q, parameter γ, and parameter Ѱ. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on the results obtained to confirm their reliability and stability and to examine the change that occurred to them as a result of the change in some inputs and parameters. In decision-making approaches, some parameters are defined subjectively based on the perception of the problem by decision-makers and the extent of the risks in the environment. Consequently, these parameters change according to the circumstances in which the decision-making system is being modeled. In our proposed Entropy-CoCoSo q-ROF approach, three parameters—q, γ, and Ѱ—are defined, which are determined based on the personal preferences of the experts. Accordingly, several changes were made to these parameters to show their decisive influence on the final IDS’s ranking results. These changes were divided into four scenarios. The first scenario refers to the change in the values of parameter q. The second scenario indicates the change in the values of parameter γ. The third scenario refers to the change in the values of parameters q and γ. Lastly, the fourth scenario refers to the change in the values of parameter Ѱ.</div><div class='html-p'>The first scenario is the effect of a change in parameter q on the evaluation of IDSs.

Conclusions</h2><div class='html-p'>Given the spread of computer networks and the dependence of public and private institutions on their efficiency and quality of work, any disruption or sabotage of them may lead to great losses. Information systems and networks are constantly subject to cyber-attacks. Thus, firewalls and antivirus are not enough to fend off all these attacks, as they are only able to protect the “front entrance” of computer systems and networks. IDSs can help protect your corporation from malicious activities. There are different types of IDSs to protect networks, as intrusion attacks are becoming more and more common on a global scale. In addition, hackers using new technologies are trying to penetrate systems. An IDS is a tool that identifies these attacks and will take an immediate step to get the system back to normal, as the IDS can also detect network traffic and send an alarm if a breach is found.</div><div class='html-p'>In this regard, this study discusses the most effective and used IDSs. This study was conducted with the participation of many experts under the q-ROF environment to deal with the uncertainty that may occur as a result of different circumstances and differences in evaluation frameworks. Six intrusion-detection systems, namely, Suricata (<math display='inline'><semantics>

The sub-aspects, on the basis of which the effectiveness of the intrusion-detection systems was evaluated, were HIDS, NIDS, hybrids, host log files, network packets, application log files, IDS sensors alerts, applications, network, host, open-source, closed source, and freeware. A hybrid MCDM approach, including q-ROF entropy-CoCoSo techniques, was proposed, where entropy was applied to evaluate the main criteria and their sub-aspects. The CoCoSo method is applied to rate six IDSs according to their effectiveness. Afterward, comparative and sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the stability, reliability, and performance of the proposed approach. The findings indicate that most of the IDSs appear to be systems with high potential. According to the results, Suricata is the best IDS that relies on multi-threading performance. Although the results here confirm that the proposed method is applicable and effective, it has some limitations. The key limitation of the approach is the difficult mathematical algorithm for the computation of Hamacher functions.</div></section>
